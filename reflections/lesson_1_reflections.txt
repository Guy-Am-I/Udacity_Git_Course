1.
Diff helps spot differences between lines of code; and therfore easier to spot bugs.
That said it was not the most understandable and there are better ways to compare files which highlight the changes.

2.
Having easy access to file history could help me avoid writing duplicate code as well as save time debugging.
If I know that a specific file is working than I can deduce that a new bug would be the direct result of code
I added afterwards.

3.
Pro - more meaningful saves and easier to keep track of where changes happend - versions
Con - can forget to manually save and therfore lose changes made, where as automatically there is no worries but the saves are less meaningful.

4.
Saving multiple files makes logical sense when creating versions of projects, since each version needs all of the files to work properly.
where as google docs is more about savign documents and papers which do not rely on other docs to operate.

5.
With version control I can save a working copy of my program and then proceed to make whatever changes I want with the knowledge
that if any bugs appear I could always revert back to my original version

6.
Solving my homework smarter - meaning actually saving versions of programs after every change instead of writing all of the code at one
this way debugging would be way easier and in the long run much easier to understand the chagnes and the code.
